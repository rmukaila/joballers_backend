## Description
This is the backend/webservice that works with the frontend (https://github.com/rmukaila/joballers_frontend) of the joballers.onrender.com website I created.
the database used is mongo DB and it is hosted on a separate server Atlas. That's, the frontend and backend microservices 
are on the same hosting site (render.com) while the monggodb is hosted on an Atlas cluster in a separate server.
